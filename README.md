Simple Shell Project
Project Description

This project is a collaboration as a part of the ALX curriculum. The project involves creating a simple UNIX command interpreter (shell) that runs command line instructions for users.

Project Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

    Everything you need to know before approaching the Project

Project Tasks

    Writing a simple UNIX command interpreter.
    Implements built-in functions
    Handles commands with arguments
    Handles the PATH
    Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
    Handle Ctrl+C: your shell should not quit when the user inputs ^C
    Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we expect you to be able to answer the following questions:

    Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system?
    Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell?
    Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)?
    Who is Ken Thompson?
    How does a shell work?
    What is a pid and a ppid?
   How to manipulate the environment of the current process?
    What is the difference between a function and a system call?
    How to create processes?
    What are the three prototypes of main?
    How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs?
    How to execute another program with the execve system call?
    How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates?
    What is EOF / "end-of-file"?

Our program must have the same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output unless specified otherwise. The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].
